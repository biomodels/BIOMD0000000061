# Model Notes


The model reproduces Fig 6 of the paper. The stoichiometry and rate of
reactions involving uptake of metabolites from extracellular medium have been
changed corresponding to Yvol (ratio of extracellular volume to cytosolic
volume) mentioned in the publication. The extracellular and cytosolic
compartments have been set to 1. Concentration of extracellular glucose, GlcX,
is set to 6.7 according to the equation for cellular glucose uptake rate in
Table 7 of the paper. The model was successfully tested on MathSBML and Jarnac
